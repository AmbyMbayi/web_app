	<p>Learn enoough to be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling erros messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darnthing. We believe there are at least a <strong>billion people</strong>  who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.
